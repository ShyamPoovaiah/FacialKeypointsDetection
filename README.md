# Facial Keypoints Detection

## Motive
Faces have always intringued me. From reading Paul Ekman's 'Unmasking the face' to staring at my opponent's face across the ring unable to 
decide if he is really going to throw that punch, it is always exciting. After joining a deep learning course at 
Indian Institute of Science we decided to go work on faces.
